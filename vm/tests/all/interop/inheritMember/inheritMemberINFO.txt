//inheritMember.txt

'inheritMember' is an example for polyglot language interoperability, based on a common data struct/class. 

'inheritMember.*' contains a program itself (='main method'), 'inheritMemberClass.*' contains the data structure needed. 

class LinearFunction: 
	(int) members k and d (taken by constructor, stored as field).
	method: int -> int, x -> k*x+d

class ConstFunction extends LinearFunction:
	constructor takes (int) d and calls super constructor(k=0, d=d).
